First of all there is a slight change in packaging  as the cap is a air tight cap different  from pre corona  packaging, it is different  just to prevent the alcohol content from any leakage or drying.Secondly its absolutely  safe i have ordered the product and still using it regularly, see the thing is they have increased the composition  of alcohol in the sanitizer  for  better protection  from corona as it says it has 95% Ethyl so dont woery its absolutely  safe abd change in smell is due to increased  composition  of ethyl in it
And it even has batch no.  Licence date of packaging and hall mark of hindustan unilever so don't  panic its absolutely  safe and brand life lifebuoy will never cheat,  i repeat its absolutely  safe and  like any other sanitizer it has a cooling effect after applying to your hands thats a sign of alcohol content in it which makes it a  pure and safe sanitizer <U+0001F600>",5.0 out of 5 stars,0.21355820105820106,0.4414428164428164,+1

130,Most Probably Original.,2020-05-24,"I will sum up my review in following parts.
1. Cap- The first thing I noticed before ordering is that many people received a bottle with different cap, so did I. The only reason I could think of is that company might have run out of red cap. Also checked with other customers on different websites and some of them have also received the product with different cap.
2. Smell/Scent- The sanitizer has strawberry smell, which is different from the other lifebuoy sanitizer but it might be due to the fact that this sanitizer has different composition that the one we buy at our local shop.
3. I checked for any tampering with the bottle but even the Cap has two seals, one at the top of the bottle which we will need to remove before using the sanitizer and the other at the bottom to remove the whole cap from the bottle this is visible in many photos submitted by other reviewers.
4. The sanitizer is flammable so it  does contain a good amount of alcohol.
Overall I am satisfied with the product. But they need to provide a disclaimer about the cap and that the image might be different then the original product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,0.12083333333333333,0.46493055555555546,+1

The product contains the required amount of alcohol or not, that's what matters. and if u just take a drop between your fingers and rub it for a few seconds, it will rapidly evaporate, which ensures that it indeed contains a high amount of alcohol. I have compared it with Apollo life hand sanitizer (bought from Apollo pharmacy) which contains 60% alcohol, and this one indeed evaporates much faster than that. And as for the cap, it comes with a high quality seal-able cap! the red cap which is shown in the picture is not seal-able and might cause spillage during shipping. it has a nice blue gasket around the dispensing hole which forms a tight seal when closed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,0.06814285714285714,0.2865714285714286,+1

423,Highly recommended,2020-06-13,"Have been using lifebuoy for a long time. Great product to have during this pandemic. This sanitizer has a good fragrance that last for a while. Quality is very nice as compared to others. It contains 95% ethile alcohol and this sanitizer is gel based. One of the most important thing is that it's consistency is thicker than others. I got a dispenser type bottle in seal pack condition. I am extremely satisfied as it's lifebuoy product and did justice to the brand name.
